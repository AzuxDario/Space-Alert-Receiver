# Space-Alert-Receiver
The Space Alert Receiver is a server, which was written during the hackathon - "Rzethon by G2A" in 2016.
This project was created in a 4-person group including me, https://github.com/PPalac, https://github.com/danielmoskal and https://github.com/ostatni.
Our main goal was to create system that will help astronauts during space missions. System which was modeled by mobile app constantly monitors astronaut vital data, as well as condition of his space suit, and in case of danger, astronaut can with one click call for help, by sending information to the crew, e.g. on board. Additionally there was 3 beacons which provided location of astronauts. Beacons was modeled by app on our laptops and their BT receivers.
